Clone the repo, `cd` in and run `./setup-venv.sh`. This script will create a `venv` and 
install python requirements, `Docker` and `Docker Desktop`. To verify the installation ran
correctly, run `sudo docker compose up` and visit `localhost:8010` in your browser.

These scripts are only verified in Ubuntu 20.04 but should run in other versions. On other 
operating systems, you will have to install the dependencies manually.
